# Movie-Recommender-System
This notebook builds a music recommendation system by cleaning data, creating a userâ€“item matrix, and applying user-based, item-based, and SVD models to predict ratings. It also recommends playlists and similar users, wraps steps into functions, and integrates with Streamlit for real-time, efficient recommendations.
